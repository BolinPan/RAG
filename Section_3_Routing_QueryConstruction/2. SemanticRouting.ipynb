    "# Semantic Routing Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic routing uses embeddings to intelligently route queries to the most appropriate handler based on semantic similarity. Instead of using explicit rules or structured outputs, semantic routing embeds both the incoming query and candidate prompts/instructions, then selects the best match based on embedding similarity. This approach is flexible and works well for routing to domain-specific experts or specialized processing pipelines.\n",

    "## What this notebook contains\n",
    "- Creating embeddings for different prompt templates (physics and math).\n",
    "- Computing cosine similarity between a query embedding and prompt embeddings.\n",
    "- Routing queries to the most semantically similar prompt/expert based on similarity scores.\n",

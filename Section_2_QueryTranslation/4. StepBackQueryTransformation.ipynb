    "# Step-Back Query Transformation Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "The step-back query transformation technique improves retrieval by asking an LLM to paraphrase a user question into a more generic, foundational question before retrieval. This approach helps mitigate the limitations of distance-based retrieval by decomposing complex questions into simpler sub-problems that are easier to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this notebook contains\n",
    "- Using few-shot prompting to transform specific questions into step-back questions.\n",
    "- Retrieving documents using both the original question and the step-back question.\n",
    "- Building a RAG pipeline that combines context from multiple retrieval strategies to generate comprehensive answers."

This allows the agent to efficiently handle complex tasks by dividing them into smaller components that can be tackled individually. By decomposing tasks, LLM agents can effectively plan and execute tasks by focusing on specific subgoals, dependencies, and arguments associated with each task. This approach enables the agent to parse user requests, identify task types, assign unique IDs, determine dependencies between tasks, and gather necessary arguments to successfully complete the overall task. Through the use of few-shot examples, LLM agents are guided in task parsing and planning, ultimately improving their ability to handle a wide range of tasks in a more efficient and effective manner.'"
